This change unlocks access to borrowing for many checking account customers with low credit scores who could not otherwise qualify for bank credit. Banks have found that these customers are likely to repay the loans because of their prior relationship with the bank and because the loans are repaid in affordable installments over several months.

The maximum amount of these loans is set at $500 or $1,000, depending on the bank, enabling consumers to borrow as much as they would from a payday lender but at a much lower cost and with strong safeguards. Payday loans usually carry interest rates over 300% and often have unaffordable lump-sum payments that can eat up a large chunk of borrowersâ€™ regular paychecks. In most cases, repeated usage leads to borrowers carrying costly debt for many months.
