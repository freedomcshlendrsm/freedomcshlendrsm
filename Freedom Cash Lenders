The large banks offering small-dollar loans are charging prices that are at least 15 times lower than average payday lenders. The loans are repayable over three to four months, which is in line with consumers’ views of the time necessary to repay small loans. Compared with typical payday loans, which keep borrowers indebted for five months of the year on average, consumers can save hundreds of dollars using the banks’ loans instead. For example, the average cost to borrow $400 for three months from a payday lender is $360; meanwhile, these banks are charging $24 or less for that credit. Similarly, the average cost to borrow $500 for four months from a payday lender is more than $500 in fees alone while the cost to borrow that through one of these bank programs is, at most, $35.
